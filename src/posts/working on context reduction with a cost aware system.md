started project with the vision to find unused contexts (cold contexts) and summarizing them then having the full context in a blob away from the main convo, drew a diagram and sketched the system (Jan 19th)
while dipshits cut the fucking internet for 2 weeks 
not only internet but EVERY form of communication even SMS and GSM 

I was nearly shot maybe 7 times 
the teargas probably had some unknown neurotoxin that fucked up my lung irreversibly, i developed some kinda asthma ever since that day

now I'm working on the system and I see it 
there needs to be a tree structure with one spine with one end being the user and the other being the LLM 
it's a graph like system wtf is happening my internet is gone again (Jan 31)
But the system I was working on I called it CRS or Context Reduction System, it worked in a 3 stage process 
summarize, compress, reference
That seemed like bullshit tho so I had to get my hands dirty
Will be updating once the internet is back
